Non-RT RIC Control Panel Overview
=================================

Graphical user interface with the following capabilities:

*  View and Manage A1 policies in the RAN (near-RT-RICs)
*  Graphical A1 policy creation/editing is model-driven, based on policy typeâ€™s JSON schema
*  View and manage producers and jobs for the Enrichment coordinator service
*  Configure A1 Policy Management Service (add/remove near-rt-rics)

The Control Panel frontend interacts with the A1 Policy Management Service and A1 Enrichment Information Coordinator
(REST NBIs) via a service exposure gateway, the Nonrtric Gateway. The frontend is developed using the Angular framework.
The Gateway is a Spring Cloud Gateway that provides an API Gateway for all the Non-RT-RIC Components.

   It is fully supported in Firefox and Chrome. Minor issues in Safari.
   Not supported in Microsoft Edge and IE.
